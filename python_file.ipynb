    "1. Easy to understand -> Python is simple language. It has many different library which is used in different application like data science, machine learning, web developement.\n",
    "2. Free and open source -> It is freely available at its offical website. It is open source which means we can downlaod source code also.\n",
    "3. Object Oriented Language -> It supports all features of object oriented programming like concepts of class,object, encapsulation etc.\n",
    "4. In python, the varaible data type does not need to be specified. The memory is automatically allocated at runtime. There is no need of specifying data type.\n",
