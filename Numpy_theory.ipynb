    "Parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "ary: The input array that you want to split.\n",
    "indices_or_sections: This can be an integer or an array-like object. If it is an integer, it specifies the number \n",
    "of equal parts to split the array into. If it is an array-like object, it specifies the indices at which to split \n",
    "the array.\n",
    "axis: The axis along which to split the array. The default is 0, meaning that the split occurs along the first \n",

    "'''\n",
    "Vectorization and broadcasting are two fundamental concepts in NumPy that contribute significantly to efficient \n",
    "array operations, enabling operations to be performed without the need for explicit loops in Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Vectorization->Vectorization refers to the process of converting scalar operations into vector operations. \n",
    "In NumPy, this means performing element-wise operations on entire arrays rather than iterating through individual \n",
    "elements with loops. This approach utilizes highly optimized C and Fortran code underneath NumPy, leading to \n",

    "\n",
    "Key Features\n",
    "Element-wise Operations: Operations on NumPy arrays can be applied to all elements at once.\n",
    "Performance Boost: Vectorized operations are typically much faster than their non-vectorized counterparts\n",
    "(i.e., for-loops in Python) because they leverage lower-level optimizations and avoid the overhead of Python’s \n",
    "loop control.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",

    "without actually copying data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rules of Broadcasting\n",
    "Broadcasting follows a set of rules to determine how to align arrays of different shapes:\n",
    "\n",
    "If the arrays have different numbers of dimensions, the shape of the smaller-dimensional array is padded with \n",
    "ones on the left side until both shapes are the same length.\n",
    "The sizes of the dimensions are compared element-wise. If the sizes differ, the array with size 1 is stretched \n",
    "to match the size of the other array.\n",
    "If any dimension sizes are incompatible and not equal, a broadcasting error occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "a = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])\n",
