    "\n",
    "1. Single Inheritance->In single inheritance, a subclass inherits from one superclass. This is the most basic form \n",

    "\n",
    "Example:\n",

    "2. Multiple Inheritance->In multiple inheritance, a subclass can inherit from more than one superclass. \n",
    "The subclass inherits properties and methods from all parent classes.\n",

    "Example:\n",

    "# 7.What is the Method Resolution Order (MRO) in Python? How can you retrieve it programmatically?\n",
    "'''\n",
    "Method Resolution Order (MRO) is the order in which Python looks for a method or attribute in a class hierarchy \n",
    "when it is called. It defines the path that Python follows to resolve methods and attributes in classes that \n",
    "involve inheritance (especially in cases of multiple inheritance).\n",
    "Python uses the C3 Linearization algorithm (also known as the C3 superclass linearization) to determine the MRO. \n",
    "This ensures a consistent and predictable order for method resolution, respecting the order of base classes and \n",
    "handling multiple inheritance scenarios in a well-defined manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Single Inheritance: In the case of single inheritance, MRO is straightforward — Python searches for methods and \n",
    "attributes in the current class and then moves up the chain of superclasses until it finds the method or reaches \n",
    "the top of the hierarchy (typically object).\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple Inheritance: In multiple inheritance, MRO follows a more complex path where Python first looks at the \n",
    "    current class, then checks the parent classes from left to right (in the order they are inherited), and \n",
    "    finally goes up the hierarchy according to the C3 Linearization rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of MRO in Multiple Inheritance:\n",
    "class A:\n",
    "    def process(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Process method in A\")\n",
    "class B(A):\n",

    "        print(\"Process method in B\")\n",

    "        print(\"Process method in C\")\n",
    "class D(B, C):\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "d = D()\n",
    "d.process()  # Output: Process method in B\n",
    "\n",
    "When d.process() is called on an instance of D, Python follows the MRO to find the process method.\n",
    "The MRO for class D is: D -> B -> C -> A. Therefore, the method from B is executed because it appears before\n",
    "C in the MRO.\n",
    "\n",
    "Retrieving MRO Programmatically:\n",
    "We can retrieve the Method Resolution Order in Python using the __mro__ attribute or the built-in mro() method.\n",
