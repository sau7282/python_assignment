       "' In Python programming,both tuples and sets have specific use cases based on their properties.\\nUse Cases of Tuples:\\n1. Immutable Data Collections->Tuples are immutable, meaning they cannot be changed after creation. \\nThis makes them ideal for representing data that should remain constant throughout the program.\\n\\nExample:\\nHost and port settings\\nserver_config = (\"localhost\", 8080)  \\n\\n2. Returning Multiple Values from Functions:->Tuples are commonly used for returning multiple values from a \\nfunction in a clean and efficient way.\\n\\nExample:\\ndef get_min_max(numbers):\\n    return (min(numbers), max(numbers))\\nmin_val, max_val = get_min_max([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\\n\\n3. Storing Heterogeneous Data->Tuples can store multiple types of data, making them useful for representing a \\nstructured entity or record that contains different types of information.\\n\\nExample:\\nName, age, job, salary\\nemployee = (\"John\", 35, \"Developer\", 75000)  \\n\\n4. Using Tuples as Dictionary Keys->Because tuples are hashable (immutable), they can be used as keys in \\ndictionaries, unlike lists, which are mutable.\\n\\nExample:\\nCity and country as keys\\nlocations = {(\"New York\", \"USA\"): 8.4, (\"Paris\", \"France\"): 2.1} \\n\\n5. Packing and Unpacking->Tuples allow packing multiple values into a single variable and unpacking them into \\nindividual variables.\\n\\nExample:\\npoint = (5, 10)\\nx, y = point  \\n\\n\\nUse Cases of Sets:\\n1. Removing Duplicates->One of the most common use cases for sets is automatically removing duplicate values from \\na list or collection.\\nExample:\\nnumbers = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5]\\nunique_numbers = set(numbers)\\n\\n2. Efficient Membership Testing->Sets allow for fast membership testing (i.e., checking if an element exists in the set) with O(1) time complexity, \\nmaking them ideal for such scenarios.\\n\\nExample:\\nmy_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\\nprint(3 in my_set)  \\nTrue\\nprint(10 in my_set)  \\nFalse\\n\\n3. Set Operations (Union, Intersection, Difference)->Sets are designed for performing mathematical operations \\nlike union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference.\\n\\nExample:\\nset_a = {1, 2, 3, 4}\\nset_b = {3, 4, 5, 6}\\n\\nUnion\\nprint(set_a | set_b)  # {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\\nIntersection\\nprint(set_a & set_b)  # {3, 4}\\nDifference\\nprint(set_a - set_b)  # {1, 2}\\n\\n4. Handling Large Datasets Efficiently->Sets are useful when working with large datasets, especially when \\nyou need to compare, find unique elements, or perform operations like intersection and union efficiently.\\n\\nExample:\\nlarge_set_a = {x for x in range(1000000)}\\nlarge_set_b = {x for x in range(500000, 1500000)}\\ncommon_elements = large_set_a & large_set_b  # Intersection\\n\\n5. Filtering Unique Values->When working with a stream of data, such as user input or file data, sets can be \\nused to filter out duplicates and ensure that only unique values are kept.\\n\\nExample:\\nemails = [\"test@example.com\", \"admin@example.com\", \"test@example.com\"]\\nunique_emails = set(emails)  '"
