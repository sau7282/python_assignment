Iterable->An iterable is any Python object capable of returning its members one at a time. \\nIt can be passed to the iter() function to get an iterator. An object is considered iterable if it \\nimplements the __iter__() method, which returns an iterator. \\nExamples of iterables include data structures like lists, tuples, strings, dictionaries, sets, and \\neven file objects.\\n\\nExample:\\nLists: [1, 2, 3]\\nStrings: \"Hello\"\\nSets: {1, 2, 3}\\n\\nExample:\\nmy_list = [1, 2, 3] \\nfor item in my_list:\\n    print(item) \\n    \\n2. Iterator->An iterator is an object that represents a stream of data, and it can be used to traverse through \\nall the values of an iterable, one by one.\\nAn iterator is an object that implements two methods:\\n__iter__() – This method returns the iterator object itself.\\n__next__() – This method returns the next element from the iterator.

In contrast, regular functions \\nthat return collections (like lists or tuples) allocate memory for all the elements upfront, \\nwhich can be inefficient for large datasets.\\n\\nExample:\\ndef count_up_to(n):\\n    for i in range(n):\\n        yield i\\n\\ndef count_up_to_list(n):\\n    return list(range(n))\\n    \\nIf n is a large number, the generator is much more memory-efficient because it yields values one by one, \\nwhile the regular function returns a complete list, which consumes a lot of memory.\\n\\n2. Performance and Speed->Generators are generally faster for large or infinite sequences because they compute and \\nyield values as needed, rather than constructing the entire result at once. This also reduces initialization \\ntime when handling large datasets.\\n\\nExample: \\nIf you only need the first 10 items of a large sequence, a generator can start yielding those items \\nimmediately, without waiting to generate the entire sequence.\\n\\n3. Suitability for Infinite Sequences->Generators can handle infinite sequences efficiently because they do not\\nneed to store all values in memory. Regular functions, on the other hand, cannot return infinite sequences \\nsince they would attempt to store all values, which is impossible.\\n\\nExample: A generator that produces Fibonacci numbers infinitely:\\n\\ndef fibonacci():\\n    a, b = 0, 1\\n    while True:\\n        yield a\\n        a, b = b, a + b\\n        \\nA regular function would run into memory or performance issues if tasked with returning an infinite sequence.\\n\\n4. State Persistence Without Complexity->Generators automatically save their state between calls to next() \\n(or between iterations in a for loop), making them ideal for tasks like reading large files line by line. \\nThis allows for efficient handling of ongoing processes without the complexity of managing state manually.\\n\\nExample: Reading a large file line by line using a generator:\\n\\ndef read_large_file(file_name):\\n    with open(file_name) as file:\\n        for line in file:\\n            yield line\\nA regular function would have to load the entire file into memory at once or maintain complex state.\\n\\n5. Cleaner and More Readable Code->Generators often make the code more concise and readable, especially for \\nsequences or iterations where the result is produced progressively. The use of yield in place of explicit state\\nmanagement or large data structures simplifies the logic of the function.\\n\\nExample:\\nGenerator-based Fibonacci sequence:\\ndef fibonacci():\\n    a, b = 0, 1\\n    while True:\\n        yield a\\n        a, b = b, a + b\\n        \\nRegular function equivalent:\\ndef fibonacci(n):\\n    result = []\\n    a, b = 0, 1\\n    while len(result) < n:\\n        result.append(a)\\n        a, b = b, a + b\\n    return result\\n    \\nThe generator version is simpler and avoids managing a list manually.\\n\\n6. Pipelining Operations (Composability)->Generators allow for chaining operations in a pipeline, where each step\\nprocesses a stream of data lazily.

    "Typical Use Cases for Lambda Functions:\n",
    "1. Used as Arguments to Higher-Order Functions->Lambda functions are commonly used as arguments to higher-order \n",
    "functions such as map(), filter(), and sorted(), where a simple, temporary function is needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "map(): Applies a function to all items in an iterable.\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "squared = map(lambda x: x**2, numbers)\n",
    "print(list(squared))  \n",
    "Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Used for Simple One-Line Functions->When a simple operation is needed for a short period, and defining a \n",
    "full function with def would make the code unnecessarily verbose, lambda functions offer a concise alternative.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "product = lambda a, b: a * b\n",
    "print(product(4, 5)) \n",
    "Output: 20\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Used with Functions Like reduce()->Lambda functions are also commonly used with the reduce() function, which \n",
    "reduces a sequence into a single value by repeatedly applying a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "from functools import reduce\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "product = reduce(lambda x, y: x * y, numbers)\n",
    "print(product)  \n",
    "Output: 120\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Used for Conditional Logic in Small Functions->Lambda functions can handle simple conditional logic for \n",
    "cases that do not require a full function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "check_even_odd = lambda x: \"Even\" if x % 2 == 0 else \"Odd\"\n",
    "print(check_even_odd(4))  \n",
    "Output: Even\n",
    "print(check_even_odd(7))  \n",
    "Output: Odd\n",
    "\n",
    "Lambda functions in Python are anonymous, small, one-liner functions defined using the lambda keyword.\n",
    "They are typically used for short, simple operations, especially as arguments to higher-order functions \n",
    "(map(), filter(), sorted(), etc.).\n",
    "They provide a concise way to define functions without the need for a def block.\n",
    "However, for more complex operations or when reusability is important, regular functions should be preferred.\n",
